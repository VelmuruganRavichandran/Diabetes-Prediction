# Diabetes Prediction

## Project Description

This project aims to build a robust classification model to predict whether a person has diabetes or not based on various health indicators. By leveraging historical data and advanced machine learning techniques, I developed a reliable tool that can assist healthcare providers in early diagnosis and decision-making. The project involves analyzing health metrics to identify patterns and build predictive models for diabetes.

## Dataset Information

The dataset used for this project includes the following features:

- **Pregnancies**: Number of pregnancies
- **Glucose**: Glucose level in blood
- **BloodPressure**: Blood pressure measurement

## Results

The project evaluates the classification models using various performance metrics:

- **Confusion Matrix**: A table used to describe the performance of the classification model.
- **Precision Score**: Measures the accuracy of positive predictions.
- **Recall Score**: Measures the ability of the model to find all relevant cases.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Classification Report**: Provides a summary of the precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
- **ROC AUC Score**: Measures the area under the ROC curve, representing the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
- **ROC Curve**: Plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate.
